# Redbus-Data-Scraping-with-Selenium-Dynamic-Filtering-using-Streamlit
This project is a **Streamlit web application** that connects to a MySQL database and displays bus route details based on user input. Users can search bus routes, filter by star rating and bus type, and sort prices. It's inspired by real-time bus booking systems like Redbus.
